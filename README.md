# GnomishVendorShrinker
Compact Scrollable Merchant frames with search and other amenities for World of Warcraft Classic

## Attribution
Based off Tekkub's (teknologic) Gnomish Vendor Shrinker and contributions from Gio-Flamelash

## Features
- Simple one-line-per-item interface
- Scrolling list, none of that "paging" crap that makes navigation slow
- Clicking an item simply buys it, instead of picking up the item
- Alt-click buys a full stack (or as close to a full stack as is possible for limited-stock items)
- Recipes you do not yet know are highlighted in blue
- Items you cannot use are highlighted in red
- Search box to help you find that item you're after on a vendor with hundreds of items

## Installation
Get it from one of the major addon hosting sites (curseforge, wowinterface)
or [latest release](https://github.com/Road-block/GnomishVendorShrinker/releases/latest)
